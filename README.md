# OBS-CustRNN

## Introduction

This plugin is for creating a custom version of RNNoise trained to your voice (or whatever you'd like I guess)

## How to:

Training Rnnoise is a whole other topic, for the moment I will assume you know enough about ML to know what's needed here.
Once trained, we will need rnn_data.c that is generated by the `dump_rnn.py` script, and replace the existing one in `src/rnnoise/src` with it (the one already there is trained for my own voice ðŸ˜Š)

Once that's done, you can either push to github, and optionally create a tag, and download the artifacts from github actions, or build locally.

## building locally

I built locally under windows 11 sucessfully by downloading the obs dependencies, the obs repository, and building obs, and then pointing cmake to some of the outputs from those steps with the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable. YMMV going about it this way.
